# Simple Budget React App copy

App will help you create and follow a budget.

Original creation from web dev simplified, using his original set up as a way to learn, review, and better understand key concepts like:
    1) useContext
    2) bootStrap/React
    3) component arrangement


from original project I plan to build new features to the app, possible options:
    1) option to save and download budget info for later?
        like dropbox, create link and send to people? 
    2) pie chart for total, giving insight into expenses?
    3) edit budget name
    4) edit expense name, value
    5) be able to arrange budget cards
